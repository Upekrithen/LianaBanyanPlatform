# Augur Post-Audit Violation Supersede

**Augur:** Augur-Pricing  
**Violating file:** `C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\LianaBanyanPlatform\BISHOP_DROPZONE\00_FOUNDER_REVIEW\PAWN_REPORT_AI_COMPANY_SAVINGS_MATH_BP092.md`  
**Detected:** 2026-06-24T00:31:37Z

## Violation Signal

WARN [Augur-Pricing] (PostToolUse audit — not blocking): Membership pricing ≠ $5/year detected.
LB membership is $5/year, identical for every member from day one through year fifty.
No tiers, no early-adopter pricing, no entry fees. Lifetime guarantee at signup price.
Note: API spend, compute cost, Pawn run budgets, 'Member count', and 'threshold' (canonical Amplifier naming) do NOT trigger this Augur (K514.5/K527 tuned).
Context exemptions: '$5/year membership unchanged', 'membership-orthogonal', 'pricing identical for all', '(industry term)' suppress false positives when present in the diff.
Path exemptions: Amplifier AA Formals (#2318-2320), project_amplifier_program_*, voucher_tiers/, BRIDLE_RULES/, sentinel_severity_tiers/.
See: project_membership_pricing_identical_for_all.md

## Action Required

This file was written with content that triggered the **Augur-Pricing** Augur.
The write was **NOT blocked** (PostToolUse audit mode — KN043 BP005).
Bishop must reconcile: either correct the violating file or ratify an exemption.

## Stone Tablet Pattern

This supersede stub follows the BP005 Skipping Stones extension:
- D.2 KN043: NO destructive operations. Write succeeded; this stub points
  to the canonical correction needed.
- Per Hugo clarification examples: supersede stubs carry `status: pending_reconciliation`.
  Once Bishop reconciles, update status to `reconciled` and note the resolution.
